* Being emotional is good. You feel everything and sometimes that feeling can become deep. 

* Now, that's where the problem begins. The peril knocks at your
door when you get involved with too much of anything but you are a poet
Mritunjay and you are meant to think deeply and feel all the more deeply?

* Right, but be ready to pay the price. The deeper you go, the lonelier you become
and you can't and you shouldn't blame anyone for that! You are responsible for it!
Ownership of the responsibility is important - and that's what leaders do?

* And this was the mistake you did all day today. Fret not, it is normal
but you are aware and you will overcome of it all.

* Your strength is that your know your weaknesses ðŸŒ¸
