## Basics
* C++ type int is a 32-bit type, which means that every int number consists of 32 bits

* Below is a reminder of basic use of all bit wise operators.
```c

// C Program to demonstrate use of bitwise operators 
#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
    // a = 5(00000101), b = 9(00001001) 
    unsigned char a = 5, b = 9; 
  
    // The result is 00000001 
    printf("a = %d, b = %d\n", a, b); 
    printf("a&b = %d\n", a & b); 
  
    // The result is 00001101 
    printf("a|b = %d\n", a | b); 
  
    // The result is 00001100 
    printf("a^b = %d\n", a ^ b); 
  
    // The result is 11111010 
    printf("~a = %d\n", a = ~a); 
  
    // The result is 00010010 
    printf("b<<1 = %d\n", b << 1); 
  
    // The result is 00000100 
    printf("b>>1 = %d\n", b >> 1); 
  
    return 0; 
} 
```

Output:

```
a = 5, b = 9
a&b = 1
a|b = 13
a^b = 12
~a = 250
b<<1 = 18
b>>1 = 4

```

* The left shift and right shift operators
should not be used for negative numbers.
also, `1<<33` is undefined if integers are stored using 32 bits.

* The **bitwise XOR** is the most important for technical interviews.
E.g. Find the only number that is occuring odd mumber of times problem.

* The **& operator can be used to quickly check if a number is odd
or even**. How? See this case, an odd number in its binary form
will also have 1 in its LSB (Least Signifcant Bit). This means
if x if odd then `x&1` will always return non-zero number.
**Like 101 & 001 = 001, while 100 & 001 = 0 and so on.**

* **Setting** a bit means that if K-th bit is 0, then set it to 1 and if it is 1 then leave it unchanged.
* **Clearing** a bit means that if K-th bit is 1, then clear it to 0 and if it is 0 then leave it unchanged.
* **Toggling** a bit means that if K-th bit is 1, then change it to 0 and if it is 0 then change it to 1.

## Bit Tricks that I didn't know till yet

* Upper Case English aplhabets to lower case:

```c
ch |= ' ';
//Output a
/*
Logic:
A -> 01000001          a -> 01100001
B -> 01000010          b -> 01100010
C -> 01000011          c -> 01100011

As we can see if we set 5th bit of upper case characters, 
it will be converted into lower case character. 
We have to prepare a mask having 5th bit 1 and other 0 (00100000). This 
mask is bit representation of space character (‘ ‘). 
The character ‘ch’ then ORed with mask.

Example-
ch = ‘A’ (01000001)
mask = ‘ ‘ (00100000)
ch | mask = ‘a’ (01100001)
*/
```

* Lower to Upper Case:

```c

ch |= '_';

/* Same logic as  in the previous, just the difference 
that we have to mask here with `10111111` which
corresponds to underscore.
*/
```
* Count set bits in an integer (i.e number of 1s in binary):
    * **Brian Kernighan's Algorithm**:
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    class csb {
        public:
            unsigned int countSetBits(int n)
            {
                unsigned int count = 0;
                while(n) {
                    n &= (n-1);
                    count++
                }
                return count;
            }
        };
        int main();
        {
            csb g;
            int i = 9;
            cout << g.countSetBits(i);
            return 0;
        }

    ```
    Explaination:
   n =  9 (1001)
   count = 0

   Since 9 > 0, subtract by 1 and do bitwise & with (9-1)
   n = 9&8  (1001 & 1000)
   n = 8
   count  = 1

   Since 8 > 0, subtract by 1 and do bitwise & with (8-1)
   n = 8&7  (1000 & 0111)
   n = 0
   count = 2

   Since n = 0, return count which is 2 now.

   Complexity: O(logn)

   * **Lookup Table Approach**: Still have to understand but has
    O(1) Complexity. Reference can be found [here](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#CountBitsSetTable)
