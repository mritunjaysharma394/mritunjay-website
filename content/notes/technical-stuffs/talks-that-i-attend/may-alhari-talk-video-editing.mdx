### Gist of May Alhari talk on "Learn to Make Video"
* Write a stellar video script

* Create a storyboard for your animation video

* Choose your animation video style

* Animate your video - Animaker tool (Will require more courses to do it in a professional way)

* Add background music.

* Animated videos make your message reach in a fun way and
texts can get boring. Also visual memory.
